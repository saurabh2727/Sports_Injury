Predicting days taken for a player to return to the sport after the injury.
This data mining project involves sports injury data in USA in four different sports viz. Basketball, football, hockey and baseball, where vast data has been processed using various statistical techniques into helpful information. In this report, diverse techniques are utilized to find relationships, patterns and associations among the dataset features. The data has been processed in jupyter notebok to achieve all data mining findings.

# Objective Summary

The point of research in this project is to discover relationships among sports, injury length, body parts and injury type and analyse, and to predict the injury length to return to the sport after an injury for a specific sport. Our aim is to analyse the performance of different supervised learning models with interest in the data which has been collected over the period from different sources for players performing in different sports.
